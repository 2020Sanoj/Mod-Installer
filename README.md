# Mod-Installer
With this mod installer with **Steam Controller Support** you can install **_All_ Optifine, Fabric, Forge and Iris versions**, which are working! <br/>
And you can also install my **Client Modpacks** for **1.8.9 and 1.17.x** and also download some **texture packs!** <br/>
In addition, you can save mods in **up to 8 profiles** and start Minecraft via an extra script and directly select the profile that should be loaded. <br/>
A **Minecraft Modpack** is supported at least until the next version is stable! <br/>
Modpacks always run on the **latest .x version** (for example not on 1.8.8 but alway on the latest Version, on 1.8.9) <br/>
**The exception is 1.8.9** this will receive **unlimited updates** for the time being! <br/>

**Steam:**

If you start Minecraft via Steam for controller control, you need first to add your Minecraft Launcher to Steam, to do this: <br/>
 - use https://github.com/BrianLima/UWPHook, if you use the Microsoft Store Edition! <br/>
 - or for the old Launcher, just add it in your Game Libary as a not Steam Game and select the Minecraft Launcher!  <br/>

Now simply create a file called steam.txt in your .minecraft folder <br/>
You can find an example file here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanCraftDev/Mod-Installer/main/steam.txt and add the steam rungameid of Minecraft!

How to get the Steam rungameid: <br/>
Create a desktop shortcut from the Minecraft launcher in Steam (add Minecraft launcher in Steam, in the library -> right click on the game -> Manage -> Create desktop shortcut) <br/>
Now right-click it on your desktop, select properties and copy the ID behind steam://rungameid/ under URL and now paste this ID into the steam.txt! <br/>
If you start Minecraft via the MC-Launcher, it will be started via Steam!

**Requirements**
 - Windows 10 or 11 Device with an Internet connection and a Microsoft Account connected to the Microsoft Store
 
**NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.**
